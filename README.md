# ChatZen - MERN Chat Application

ChatZen is a real-time chat application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). It offers a secure and interactive platform for users to engage in group chats and one-to-one real-time conversations. This README provides essential information on how to initialize the project and highlights its key functionalities.

## Project Overview
 
ChatZen is designed to provide a seamless and interactive chatting experience. It includes the following key features:

- **User Authentication**: Users can create accounts, sign in, and personalize their profiles. Authentication is handled securely using Firebase Authentication.

- **Group Chat**: Users can join and participate in group chats on various topics or interests. Group chats offer a platform for multiple users to engage in real-time conversations.

- **One-to-One Messaging**: ChatZen also allows users to initiate one-to-one conversations with other users. These private chats are secured and offer real-time messaging capabilities.

- **Real-Time Communication**: The application leverages the power of `socket.io` for real-time messaging. Users can instantly send and receive messages, ensuring a dynamic and interactive chat experience.

- **Message History**: ChatZen keeps track of chat histories, allowing users to view past conversations and reference previous messages.
